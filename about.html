    Being in every form of fashion from modeling & designing clothes has kept Dash Harris diversified in the fashion community but being able to tell a story with a look or a full outfit have always spoken to her substantially. Styling itself is what drives the fashion community. From being on the runway to how it's placed on the mannequin is what captures attention. Everyone is different. Certain items you might not look twice at would give another person a glow or a particular AESTHETIC.
    With her ability to give her clients a tailored made AESTHETIC she promptly made a name for herself. From styling magazine covers, video shoots, press releases for major artists such as Fivio Foreign, Young M.A, J.I the Prince of NY, Babyface Ray, and so on.
    The personalized AESTHETIC she provides for each of her clients gives an artistic few of their body of work and what they represent throughout each of their looks, from red carpets to television screens.
    Working with clients from New York City, Miami, and LA,  she stays on the move for what's next. </p> </center>

  <center>  <p class = "aboutBio"> Growing up in Harlem, New York has molded Dash from a young age.
    Being able to work beside and model for fashion pioneer Dapper Dan shaped how she viewed fashion. She was convinced never to let up and always create her own lane, never wait for it to be created.
    She valued on staying true to herself and that's what she does today with her clients AESTHETICS to always keep it truly authentic.
    She also learned about "Sunday's Best" being from Harlem. That if you look your best, not only will you feel your best but you will perform your best too.
    Confidence should always be your armor and your AESTHETIC should be your sword. </p> </center>
